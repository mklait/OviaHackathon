Myself and three other colleagues from the Startup Institute, created a team and entered the Ovia Technology Helping Women Hackathon. The hackathon took place on January 19 and 20, 2018. 

Our team came in second place with this project. This project was designed to help women access country specific healthcare information while traveling abroad and to geolocate the nearest point of care in their current location. 

We created two test cases. A user travelling to India and a user travelling to Sweden. In our test app, we use google maps to geolocate the nearest healthcare clinics to each user.
